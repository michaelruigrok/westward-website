				<p>
					We are the prime of Barreyon,<br/>
					who hark the cry of The West.<br/>
					The secrets of its wilderness,<br/>
					we crave with hearts earnest.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					While the adventure and the conquest,<br/>
					are all that many seek,<br/>
					Some come with tales of long lost tribes,<br/>
					and god-crafted antiques.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					Be we local spawn or travellers far,<br/>
					In our difference we unite,<br/>
					For attempting to travel The West alone,<br/>
					Is as foolish as leaving town at night.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					And yes, the wilds are deadly,<br/>
					They are, of course, untamed,<br/>
					But for us, it is our destiny, <br/>
					These treasures must be claimed.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					Alas, that’s how we thought it was,<br/>
					That no ambition was too much,<br/>
					But in the prehistoric depths,<br/>
					Some things are best untouched.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					And now an unspeakable horror,<br/>
					Has broken the shackles of its cave.<br/>
					As this evil now wreaks forth,<br/>
					We fear the earth shall meet its grave.<br/>

			<h2>Michael Ruigrok Presents...</h2>
			<h1>WESTWARD</h1>
			<h3>A uncreatively named <i>The West Marches</i> style Pathfinder campaign.</h3>
			<h3>Coming This Fall.</h3>
			</header>
			<div id="intro">
				<p class="blurb">Westward follows the re-founding and subsequent adventures of the Barreyon Adventurer’s Guild, as they venture into the ancient, wild and dangerous lands of the west. The guild will be made up of many separate, decentralised parties, all of which act autonomously under the guild banner.</p>

				<h2>What is a <cite>West Marches</cite> Style campaign?:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Each session is a whole, self-contained adventure, within a unified setting.</li>
					<li>Multiple, varying player parties
						<ul>
							<li>Players of each session are completely fluid. Whoever can and wants to show up at any given time.</li>
							<li>Players can jump in and out of the story whenever they like, as frequently as they like.</li>
							<li>Seriously, if you want to show up for a session once, 8 months down the road, that's fine.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Players 'commission' each session.
							<ul>
								<li>Players tell the GM what they want to do next, arrange a time/place, and who will play. The GM then prepares that session, and everyone plays.</li>
								<li>Inter-player planning &amp; communication is key.</li>
								<li>Interact with other parties through noticeboard, shared maps, whatever else you can come up with.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Civilisation is safe, the wilderness is dangerous.
							<ul>
								<li>If you need to run, run!</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Further from town, the more dangerous (and exciting!) adventures get.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Defining campaign characteristics</h2>
				<ul>
					</li>
					<li>Players drive the adventure
						<ul>
							<li>Guild is player operated</li>
							<li>Players can build infrastructure to  </li>
							<li>Experience is rewarded based on player initiative and striving for long-term goals</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The world rules override the game rules
						<ul>
							<li>And often overrides fantasy/RPG tropes</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>More serious than silly
						<ul>
							<li>Fun shenanigans are a natural part of D&amp;D, and are expected in this game.  But, the focus of the campaign is a verisimilar world.</li>
							<li>Characters shouldn't have implausible joke names.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>New player friendly
						<ul>
							<li>Showcase all the cool traditions &amp; monsters from D&amp;D’s rich history.</li>
							<li>Means being careful about spoilers, including later stage abilities, and not metagaming</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>World/Setting Characteristics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Low magic
						<ul>
							<li>People know magic exists, but very few get to see it</li>
							<li>Most magic needs to be rediscovered.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>You cannot be out of town at night.</li>
					<li>No elves exist.
						<ul>
							<li>Half-elves are known as Mer.</li>
							<li>If you really want, play a Mer with Elf stats.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Character creation</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Should make sense within pre-existing world constraints.
						<ul>
							<li>Can make up new parts of the world for your character backstory</li>
							<li>Discuss with GM first, though</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Come up with a reason for why your character wants to explore the west
						<ul>
							<li>Can be a questline, a thirst for adventure, a personal mission, etc.</li>
							<li>a goal that you’ve hand picked as being worthwhile</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Level up abilities must be gained/learned within the world/story before being used.</li>
					<li>If you’re unsure, ask!</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Parts of the World</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Barreyon</li>
				<li>Wesbond</li>
				<li>Lichton</li>
				<li>Varhenhelm</li>
				<li>Blankrock</li>
				<li>The Eastern Sea</li>
				</ul>


				<h2>Building your Character</h2>
				<p>For your character, there are only two things restrictions. First, your character should somewhat make sense within the boundaries of the world I just described. And secondly, your character should have a burning desire to venture into the west. </p>

				<p>Apart from those constraints, you have an incredible amount of free reign. You want to create an entirely new region of the world that your character hails from? Go right ahead. The context and background of your character are your chance to help shape and flesh out the world you’ll be playing in. You’ll still need to discuss anything like this with me before we play, though.</p>

				<p>To assist with the player-driven ideology of the campaign, experience isn’t given for each encounter. Instead, you level up by attaining important story milestones for your character. This is something that you’ll probably want to consider in terms of fleshing out your character, but you don’t have to worry about it right away.</p>

				<p>For our first session, all that you need to have set in stone for you character (except for stats) is what they’ve been doing before the campaign, and why they would join the adventure into the west (potentially leaving behind what they were doing beforehand). You could simply be in it for the adventure and exploration, or you could be after wealth or stories of fame. Maybe you’re trying to discover your long lost heritage, an ancient tribe of legend, or a mysterious artifact from the gods.</p>

				<p>Keep in mind, the initial motivation you give your character doesn’t have to be set in stone. They may have originally wanted to prove their worth to their unloving family, but later realised their family wasn’t worth impressing, and finding the biggest stick insect ever is what their life should really be about.</p>

				<p>If you want tips for thinking about your character, I would say pick someone with a trait you want to explore, or create a character who is someone you would want to be. If you really wanted to, just play yourself, but shoved into a fantasy land. Another tip, don’t use that stick insect idea.</p>

				<p>If you need help with the actual stat building of your character, you might these auto-generating sheets useful: </p>
				<p><a href=http://pcgen.org> http://pcgen.org</a> (requires download, but is much better than all other options)</p>
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V6l7A0kaPkPUjNlwFEqziMnE5NWnCELZ42yW4ePbexE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V6l7A0kaPkPUjNlwFEqziMnE5NWnCELZ42yW4ePbexE/edit?usp=sharing </a>

				<p>In terms of characters and the relationship to their class, the class may have some influence on their background. Characters might have an intuitive grasp of their class, in which case they might have been doing something completely different before adventuring. However, usually a character will take some time to train or learn enough that they can call themselves first level in a class. They may be self taught, practicing by themselves and learning as they go, or they may have had a teacher of some kind.</p>
