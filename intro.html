				<h2 style="display: none;">Poem</h2>
				<p>
					We are the prime of Barreyon,<br/>
					who hark the cry of The West.<br/>
					The secrets of its wilderness,<br/>
					we crave with hearts earnest.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					While the adventure and the conquest,<br/>
					are all that many seek,<br/>
					Some come with tales of long lost tribes,<br/>
					and god-crafted antiques.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					Be we local spawn or travellers far,<br/>
					In our difference we unite,<br/>
					For traversing The West alone is as daft,<br/>
					as leaving town at night.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					And yes, the wilds are deadly,<br/>
					They are, of course, untamed,<br/>
					But for us, it is our destiny, <br/>
					These treasures must be claimed.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					Alas, that’s how we thought it was,<br/>
					That no ambition was too much,<br/>
					But in the prehistoric depths,<br/>
					Some things are best untouched.<br/>
				</p>

				<p>
					And now an unspeakable horror,<br/>
					Has broken the shackles of its cave.<br/>
					As this evil now wreaks forth,<br/>
					We fear the earth shall meet its grave.<br/>

			<h2>Michael Ruigrok Presents...</h2>
			<h1>WESTWARD</h1>
			<h3>An uncreatively named <i>The West Marches</i> style Pathfinder campaign.</h3>
			<h3>Coming This Fall.</h3>
			</header>
			<div id="intro">
				<p class="blurb">Westward follows the re-founding and subsequent adventures of the Barreyon Adventurer’s Guild, as they venture into the ancient, wild and dangerous lands of the west. The guild will be made up of many separate, decentralised parties, all of which act autonomously under the guild banner.</p>

				<h2>What is a <cite>West Marches</cite> Style campaign?:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Each session is a whole, self-contained adventure, within a unified setting.
						<ul>
							<li>Sessions start and end in town, with players venturing out into the wilderness in-between.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Multiple, varying player parties
						<ul>
							<li>Players of each session are completely fluid. Whoever can and wants to show up at any given time.</li>
							<li>Players can jump in and out of the story whenever they like, as frequently as they like.</li>
							<li>Seriously, if you want to show up for a session once every 8 months, that's fine.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Players 'commission' each session.
							<ul>
								<li>Players tell the GM what they want to do next, arrange a time/place, and who will play. The GM then prepares that session, and everyone plays.</li>
								<li>Inter-player planning &amp; communication are key.</li>
								<li>Interact with other parties through noticeboards, shared maps, whatever else you can come up with.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Civilisation is safe, the wilderness is dangerous.
							<ul>
								<li>Make sure you fully utilise the assistance and resources that town provides you.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Further from town, the more dangerous (and exciting!) adventures get.
							<ul>
								<li>Be prepared, plan before you act, and if you need to run away, run!</li>
							</ul>

					</ul>

				<h2>Defining campaign characteristics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Players drive the adventure
						<ul>
							<li>Guild is player operated</li>
							<li>Players can improve &amp; upgrade infrastructure to make life easier</li>
							<li>Experience is rewarded based on player initiative and striving for long-term goals</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The world rules override the game rules
						<ul>
							<li>And often subvert fantasy/RPG tropes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>More serious than silly
						<ul>
							<li>The focus of the campaign is a verisimilar world.</li>
							<li>The fun shenanigans which are a intrinsic part of D&amp;D emerge naturally.</li>
							<li>Humour should not interfere with plausibility. i.e., no joke characters or joke names, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>New player friendly
						<ul>
							<li>Showcase all the cool traditions &amp; monsters from D&amp;D’s rich history</li>
							<li>Means being careful about spoilers, including later stage abilities, and not metagaming</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>More focus on narrative than game mechanics
						<ul>
							<li>Getting into character is highly encouraged</li>
							<li>Focusing on the crunch of character stats &amp; builds is
								fully endorsed if you want to. 
								<ul><li>
								But, keep in mind there's heaps of new players who won't be.
								Sometimes, you'll need to hold back to ensure they get their
								time to shine in battle.
								</ul></li>

				</ul>
				<h2>World/Setting Characteristics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Low magic
						<ul>
							<li>People know magic exists, but very few get to see it</li>
							<li>Most magic needs to be rediscovered.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>No elves exist.
						<ul>
							<li>Half-elves are known as Mer.</li>
							<li>If you really want, play a Mer with Elf stats.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Night is feared above all else. Nobody leaves town at night.</li>

				</ul>

				<h2>Character creation</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Should make sense within pre-described world constraints.
						<ul>
							<li>Can make up new parts of the world for your character backstory</li>
							<li>Discuss with GM first, though</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Come up with a reason for why your character wants to explore the west
						<ul>
							<li>Can be a questline, a thirst for adventure, a personal mission, etc.</li>
							<li>A goal that you’ve hand picked as being worthwhile.</li>
							<li>What were they doing beforehand? How does it fit into their class?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Level up abilities must be gained/learned within the world/story before being used.
						<ul>
							<li>These count as milestones/big experience boosters for levelling up.</li>
							<li>See more information/thoughts about levelling <a href="levelling.html">here.</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If you’re unsure about anything, ask!</li>
					<li>If we're using the Pathfinder ruleset instead of D&amp;D, you might find <a href="http://pcgen.org">PCGen</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V6l7A0kaPkPUjNlwFEqziMnE5NWnCELZ42yW4ePbexE/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a> useful for creating a character.</li>
