		<ul>
			<li>At the start of a round, each player declares what kind of action they want to take</li>
			<li>Play out the first second of the round. Each player commits to starting whatever kind of action they said they would make. This sets the momentum of each player, limiting what they can do in the action proper</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Eg, a player who is originally going to try and run two squares will have a much harder time slowing down and pulling something out of his pocket compared to someone who is moving at a slower pace.</li>
		</ul>
			<li>Each player then rolls initiative for that round, depending on the kind of action</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Ranged attack is d4</li>
			<li>Moving is d6</li>
			<li>Attacking is d8</li>
			<li>Spell is d10</li>
			<li>Anything else is d6</li>
		</ul>
			<li>Multiple actions in one round are added together</li>
			<li>Players can opt to take a penalty to delay the decision, in order to get an idea of what the enemies are doing.</li>
		</ul>
