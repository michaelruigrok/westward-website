	<body>
		<main id=app> <p>Okay, so I’ve done some thinking about our levelling up
		system and I wanted to go over a few ideas I’ve had on the topic.</p>

		<p>This decision is driven by two of the campaign’s premises: “Players are
		in charge of their own goals”, and “the world’s rules override the game’s
		rules”. In terms of leveling, these essentially mean:</p>

		<p>1: Levelling is a big, long-term reward for players meaningfully
		improving the world and themselves</p> <p>2: Upgrades &amp; abilities that
		players get from levelling up must be explainable in-game</p>

		<p>So far, we’ve been using a milestone system - you get the long term
		reward from achieving a long-term goal. I wanted players not just journey
		towards quests that I made, but to invent their own based on their
		character’s wishes. In practice, this was kind of a silly plan. You’re too
		busy focusing on navigating your character through the game to inject your
		own story into the world. </p>

		<p>As such, long term goals have mostly been a result of what’s been made
		available to your character, e.g. Kesil’s finding an injured dog lead to
		him looking for treatment. If there’s no hooks for your character, you’re
		left following other character’s plot points and can’t level up. On the
		flip side, there’s some great short-term moments of initiative, creativity,
		and tactics that really deserve to be rewarded. </p>

		<p>So I want to try two things:</p>

		<p>First, is explaining level-up upgrades as a requirement to level up, and
		to offer them as a way to milestone. In order to meet the requirement, you
		might say “I spend a couple of hours before going to bed practicing my
		weapon draw”, or you might seek training with another character. </p>

		<p>Or, you might make it a larger quest. You might travel to Wesbond to
		find a shield expert or to buy a potion-making kit. There might be rumours
		of an ancient scroll in The West that lets you catch arrows from
		mid-flight. Since every character has level-up upgrades, every player will
		have an opportunity for long-term goals, no matter the current
		narrative.</p>

		<p>In this process, it is important you discuss this with your friendly
		neighbourhood GM. If you can’t think of any way of getting it, talk to me
		and I’ll make it happen. I also need to know what to plan for in the next
		session, so telling me beforehand is important.</p>

		<p>It’ll also stop me being an idiot and making your character roll for
		things they already knows how to do</p>


		<p>Second, is swap to an XP system. Players get rewarded per scene of
		gameplay, until you get enough numbers to level up. This allows everyone to
		level up, even if they don’t have opportunities for milestones. It’ll also
		let players get immediate rewards for any good stuff they do. This will
		also continue to reward long-term goals, I’ll be giving extra XP for taking
		initiative, forward thinking and inventive ideas. Also, if you reach the
		end of a milestone with a good amount of XP, I’ll probably just give you
		the level up anyway.</p>

		<p>I’m very interested in seeing what you guys think about this. I am open
		to alternatives or variations on these ideas. For instance, we could make
		it so you earn ability upgrades separate from levelling up, But you have to
		reach the next level before you can earn any abilities associated with
		it.</p>
