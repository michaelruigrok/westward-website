			<h1>WESTWARD</h1>
			<h3>An uncreatively named <cite>The West Marches</cite> style Pathfinder campaign.</h3>
			<h2>Extra Campaign Details</h2>
			</header>
			<section id="intro">
				<p>Westward follows the re-founding and subsequent adventures of the Barreyon Adventurer’s Guild, as they venture into the ancient, wild and dangerous lands of the west. The guild will be made up of many separate, decentralised parties, all of which act autonomously under the guild banner. It is up to the players to decide the level of interaction and organisation between these groups.</p>

				<p id="west-marches">The players are founding members of the guild, and will go on adventures exploring the west. If they so desire, the players may also take a role in fostering the growth and organisation of the guild. For example, players might help maintain a base of operations, contribute to charting out the west on a guild-shared map, or make it easier for townsfolk to get in touch with the guild.</p>

				<p>Each session will feature a whole, self-contained adventure. The adventuring party of each session is completely fluid. It’ll consist of whoever can and wants to show up at any given time. Additionally, there will be other groups of players who form their own parties completely separate from your own. These players will also be part of the guild. However, since they are other player characters, it is very unlikely that you will be able to talk to them face-to-face within the game. Interaction with these players may take the form of passing messages through NPCs, notes on a notice board, or another form of time-shifted communication if you can think of one.</p>

				<p>Secondly, each session will be ‘commissioned’ by the players. You decide what the party will attempt to do in the next session, organise a time for the session to happen, and decide who’s going to play in that session. Then I’ll go and plan for that adventure, and we’ll play it.</p>

				<p>In this way, the game campaign to be somewhat player driven. It is expected that the combined goals and backstory of the players will form the meat of the campaign’s narrative arc. By doing this, it guarantees a truly compelling campaign which the players feel fully invested in. It’s not just a quest that’s been thrusted upon you, it’s a motivation that’s intrinsic to your character’s being, and it’s a goal that you’ve hand picked as being worthwhile.</p>

				<p>That doesn’t mean you're expected to have an end goal in mind, or that you have to come up with a big-picture path you want the campaign to take. Especially at the beginning. After a couple of sessions, I expect to have a wealth of townspeople requiring the services of the new guild, and you’ll have a good idea of what’s available to explore in the west. So deciding what to do in the next adventure shouldn’t be difficult. If you have set up some kind of method allowing townspeople to contact the guild for quests, we might eventually try and make a digital analogue so you can see what kinds of quests are available.</p>

				<p>In terms of the campaign style, I have a good picture in my head of what I like. But in practice, I’m a new GM, and all this might go right out the window. Overall, I just want to run a fun game where nobody is pushed out of their comfort zone or feels left out.</p>

				<p id="world-rules">I try and follow the mantra ‘the world’s rules always override the game’s rules”. I aim for a cohesive, consistent world, and like exploring the way different parts of the world influence others. I’ll be encouraging roleplaying, but I also believe a third-person explanation of your actions can be just as good in terms of immersion.</p>

				<p>The campaign will attempt to explore and subvert the assumptions a genre-savvy player might make about the campaign’s world, and the way that characters act within it. I encourage players to stick within what their characters know. Just because your character finds a ring of invisibility, it doesn't mean he immediately thinks it might be cursed relic he needs to throw in a volcano. There’s probably better examples, but whatever.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, the campaign will utilise the lack of familiarity most of our players have with D&amp;D lore. Legendary items, monsters, and abilities, which hold a special renown within the D&amp;D and RPG community may be completely unknown to new players. These provide fantastic opportunities to make dramatic and very memorable scenarios, which are why these elements became so celebrated in the first place.</p>

				<p>If I provide a piece of information which seems obviously wrong compared to your understanding of D&amp;D you want clarification on, or you wish to ask me about a high-level/cool sounding but potentially obscure feature of the game, please do so in private. Keep in mind what other players know, and consider how to enhance their experience in terms of what information you share. If I’m describing a monster and you suddenly realise what I’m building up to, feel free to gasp or whatever, that’d be great for atmosphere and building the tension. But keep what you’ve suddenly realised, or enemy weaknesses, etc. a secret.</p>

				<p>I also hope to mess around with the rules a bit to make the game realistic in my eyes. For example, you can spend your turn waiting for an enemy to attack so you can try and parry them. Actions like that are the bread and butter of real combat, but have no analogue in the D&amp;D system. Similarly, I might try and rework the initiative system entirely, using a variant of Mike Mearls’ initiative system, detailed <a href="init.html">here</a>.</p>
				<h2 id="setting">The World</h2>
				<p>Barreyon (the town which the adventure takes place), its vicinity, and the land to the east, are considered safe. It is very difficult to find trouble or harm in these areas. But there is no adventure there, either.</p>

				<p>Occasionally, adventurers may wish to travel to Barreyon’s closest neighbour, Wesbond, but may not go further. Wesbond is a sprawling city, which offers a wide variety of resources and services which can’t be found in the quite small Barreyon. However, the trip to the city is arduous and requires being well prepared for. It’s a full day’s travel away, requiring travellers to depart at dawn and arrive at sundown.</p>

				<p>This is because, even in the east, the night is feared above all else. While there are those who claim they have lasted a night outside of a town’s safety, it is far more prevalent to hear tales of people disappearing without a trace, never to be seen again.</p>

				<p>Remember, dangerous things are dangerous. There is no guarantee that you can beat every foe you face, especially if you put yourself in an unfavourable situation. Sometimes it’s best to just get out of a situation while it’s still possible to escape. Once a dead character is dead, there’s no going back.</p>

				<p>Another odd thing to note about this campaign is that elves don’t exist. You can still play an elf, though. It’s just that you’ll be a one of a kind creature (unless someone else chooses it, too) and many will treat you as totally alien. Half-elves are known as Mer.</p>
				<h2 id="character-creation">Building your Character</h2>
				<p>For your character, there are only two things restrictions. First, your character should somewhat make sense within the boundaries of the world I just described. And secondly, your character should have a burning desire to venture into the west. </p>

				<p>Apart from those constraints, you have an incredible amount of free reign. You want to create an entirely new region of the world that your character hails from? Go right ahead. The context and background of your character are your chance to help shape and flesh out the world you’ll be playing in. You’ll still need to discuss anything like this with me before we play, though.</p>

				<p>To assist with the player-driven ideology of the campaign, experience isn’t given for each encounter. Instead, you level up by attaining important story milestones for your character. This is something that you’ll probably want to consider in terms of fleshing out your character, but you don’t have to worry about it right away.</p>

				<p>For our first session, all that you need to have set in stone for you character (except for stats) is what they’ve been doing before the campaign, and why they would join the adventure into the west (potentially leaving behind what they were doing beforehand). You could simply be in it for the adventure and exploration, or you could be after wealth or stories of fame. Maybe you’re trying to discover your long lost heritage, an ancient tribe of legend, or a mysterious artifact from the gods.</p>

				<p>Keep in mind, the initial motivation you give your character doesn’t have to be set in stone. They may have originally wanted to prove their worth to their unloving family, but later realised their family wasn’t worth impressing, and finding the biggest stick insect ever is what their life should really be about.</p>

				<p>If you want tips for thinking about your character, I would say pick someone with a trait you want to explore, or create a character who is someone you would want to be. If you really wanted to, just play yourself, but shoved into a fantasy land. Another tip, don’t use that stick insect idea.</p>

				<p>If you need help with the actual stat building of your character, you might these auto-generating sheets useful: </p>
				<p><a href=http://pcgen.org> http://pcgen.org</a> (requires download, but is much better than all other options)</p>
				<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V6l7A0kaPkPUjNlwFEqziMnE5NWnCELZ42yW4ePbexE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V6l7A0kaPkPUjNlwFEqziMnE5NWnCELZ42yW4ePbexE/edit?usp=sharing </a></p>

				<p>In terms of characters and the relationship to their class, the class may have some influence on their background. Characters might have an intuitive grasp of their class, in which case they might have been doing something completely different before adventuring. However, usually a character will take some time to train or learn enough that they can call themselves first level in a class. They may be self taught, practicing by themselves and learning as they go, or they may have had a teacher of some kind.</p>
